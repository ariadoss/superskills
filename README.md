# Superskills `v2.16.1`

Curated AI skills pack for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Continue.dev, Augment Code, Windsurf, Cursor, and Cline/Roo. Bundles [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) (Garry Tan's virtual engineering team) and extends it with TDD, systematic debugging, security testing, spec workflows, knowledge base integration, and more.

33 core skills + 43 gstack skills + 173 marketing skills + 35 design skills. gstack is installed automatically and vendored in this repo so skills are available even if the upstream repo is removed.

> **[Full command reference →](COMMANDS.md)** — all skills with descriptions and overlap notes
> **[10x+ Engineering Workflow →](DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md)** — run 10+ parallel AI agents, each with a full quality pipeline ([deep dive](https://hyperion360.com/blog/parallel-ai-agents-engineering-workflow/))

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariadoss/superskills.git ~/.claude/skills/superskills
cd ~/.claude/skills/superskills && ./setup
```

Setup will:
- Install gstack (Garry Tan's virtual engineering team skills) — required, auto-installed
- Install `bun` if needed (required by gstack's browser tool)
- Prompt you to connect knowledge base repos (optional)
- Check for optional dependencies (clearwing, ffuf)
- Auto-detect and install into: **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, **Codex CLI**, **Continue.dev**, **Augment Code**, **Windsurf**
- Offer to add the developer workflow guide to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

**Project-level installs** (run from your project root):
```bash
~/.claude/skills/superskills/setup --cursor   # Cursor (.cursor/rules/)
~/.claude/skills/superskills/setup --cline    # Cline / Roo Code (.clinerules)
```

### Install as a plugin (native update alerts)

Claude Code and Codex can install superskills as a versioned **plugin**, which
gives you a native "updated" notification when a new version ships — no manual
`git pull` needed.

**Claude Code** (exposes the core + design skills; run `./setup` for the full
marketing-skills set):
```bash
/plugin marketplace add ariadoss/superskills
/plugin install superskills@superskills
/reload-plugins
```
On a new release you'll see *"Plugins updated — run `/reload-plugins`"* at startup
(with auto-update enabled for the marketplace).

**Codex CLI:**
```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ariadoss/superskills
codex plugin install superskills
```

The plugin `version` is driven by the repo's `VERSION` file via
`scripts/sync-version.sh`, so every release bumps the version the plugin systems
watch. The `./setup` install above remains the way to get **all** skills across
every supported tool.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/playwright` | E2E testing with Playwright |

### Codebase Context (from [ariadoss/repomap](https://github.com/ariadoss/repomap), [safishamsi/graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify))
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/repomap` | Generate structural map of the codebase (REPOMAP.md) |

## Knowledge Bases

During setup, you can connect any git repos as knowledge bases. The `/kb-advisor` and `/content-writer` skills will search and reference them.

Configuration lives in `~/.superskills/knowledge.conf`:

```
# name|path|description|git-url
docs|~/.superskills/knowledge/docs|Internal docs|https://github.com/org/docs.git
research|~/.superskills/knowledge/research|Research notes|https://github.com/org/research.git
```

Add more anytime by editing the file and re-running `./setup`.

## Extending for Your Team

Superskills is designed to be a generic base that teams extend with domain-specific skills:

```bash
# Your team's private repo installs superskills first, then adds custom skills
git clone https://github.com/ariadoss/superskills.git ~/.claude/skills/superskills
cd ~/.claude/skills/superskills && ./setup --quiet --no-knowledge

# Then install your team's overlay
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/your-skills
cd ~/.claude/skills/your-skills && ./setup
```

Your overlay repo can:
- Add domain-specific skills (e.g., `/your-defense` with project-specific checks)
- Pre-configure knowledge bases
- Override generic skills with customized versions

## Optional Dependencies

- `uv tool install clearwing` — for `/pentest` (source code + network scanning)
- `brew install ffuf` — for `/fuzz` (web fuzzing)
- Playwright — for `/playwright` (`npm install -D @playwright/test`)

## Engineering standards & tests

All executable code in this repo holds to [`ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`](ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md)
(TDD · DRY · SOLID · YAGNI). Shell code is unit-tested with [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core):

```bash
./tests/run.sh    # runs tests/*.bats
```

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/superskills && git pull && ./setup
```

> **Always re-run `./setup` after pulling — `git pull` alone is not enough.**
> Existing skills are live symlinks, so edits to them show up instantly. But a
> **new** skill only becomes visible once `./setup` runs again to create its
> symlink. `setup` installs a git `post-merge` hook that does this automatically
> on every pull, so after your first run you can just `git pull`. The
> `/superskills-upgrade` command also handles this for you.
